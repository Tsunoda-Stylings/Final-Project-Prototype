                        <br/><main class="interview">Interview with Brittany Knott:</main><br/>

                        <p class="blog-p"><mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Tell me a little about your background.  What made you decide to become a nurse, and why did you decide to start cultured healthcare? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark> My Background: I started working in healthcare as a patient transporter in 2006. While working as a patient transporter, I was in school earning two associate degrees from Cincinnati State Technical and Community College. The first is in Business Management, and the other is in Marketing Management. I successfully earned those degrees in 2008. After that, I decided to pursue my bachelor’s degree. I obtained my bachelor’s in business administration with a concentration in Finance from Thomas More College in 2012. <br/><br/>

While obtaining my degrees, I was surrounded by healthcare workers, yet I never desired to be a nurse. It was God who pushed me to dig deeper and gain an understanding of what the field was all about. I have always loved people, but I didn’t know what I had to offer besides my personality. Health field? Me? How? Nurses would always tell me that I would make a great nurse. I decided to get my “feet wet” and become a Patient Care Assistant. I figured working beside the nurses would give me a better understanding of their role and whether it fit me well. INSTANTLY I LOVED IT!!!! <br/><br/>

In 2016, I earned my Master of Science in Nursing degree from Mount St. Joseph University. I have even become a clinical instructor and love teaching students what I know.

I started Cultured Healthcare because I’ve witnessed too many racial disparities in the current healthcare system. After experiencing racial discrimination, intimidation, harassment, and retaliation for doing the right thing, I decided that people of color and minorities would suffer no more because I was willing to use my voice for those of us who continuously suffer in silence. Instead of being treated like assets, minority employees and patients alike are treated unfairly by those placed in positions of power. <br/><br/>

If melanated staff members are treated poorly, their corresponding patient populations can’t fare much better. Empirical data shows racial disparities are real, and my personal experiences parallel that data. Cultured Healthcare is the change the world needs to be a better place for everyone, not just one race. Cultured Healthcare - Caring For ALL Cultures Of The World!<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark>  How did you come up with the name of your company/non-profit?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark>  I came up with the name Cultured Healthcare because empirical data shows that the cultures of the world have different health concerns that affect their specific populations at different rates and levels. Healthcare and medicine have been a one size fits all cookie cutter system that leaves far too many disparities, not only in the level of care but the outcomes as well, due to deficient considerations given to the effect one’s particular culture has on their diet, perspective on acceptable medical practices and their understanding, comfort, and willingness to engage honestly when they seek the help of medical professionals. As such, only a tailor-made healthcare system based on culturally competent professionals can identify and address the nuances of how each ailment affects their specific populations and effectively educate these populations according to those culturally specific perspectives. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What is your mission/company saying? How did you come up with that?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark> Cultured Healthcare’s mission is to provide ethnocentric care facilities where health decisions are made by qualified, culturally competent healthcare professionals who look as diverse as the people they serve. Our facilities will provide professionals to represent and care for the diverse populations within our communities to alleviate healthcare disparities afflicting ethnocentric patients and healthcare workers.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What services do you offer? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark> Cultured Healthcare will provide healthcare services to patient populations. including all forms of natal and pregnancy care. Emergency, cardiac, wholistic medicine, dialysis, labor delivery, orthopedics, medical/surgical, in-patient/outpatient care, Urology, endoscopy, diagnostics, screening, oncology, and more.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark>  What services would you like to add in the future?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark> In the future, Cultured Healthcare looks to add:<br/><br/>

Mobile services<br/>
Community outreach services<br/>
Scholarship programs<br/>
Medical Research<br/>
A College of Our Own<br/>
<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What is unique about your non-profit?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark> Our non-profit is unique because it prioritizes cultural competence in care by providing a diverse group of qualified professionals who will help educate and create care plans with consideration for the differences and nuances in perspectives our patient populations hold. Representation of decision-makers in today’s healthcare system is woefully lacking diversity and inclusion of minorities and people of color. The level and proficiency of care are also drastically varied when race and culture are considered.<br/><br/>

Cultured Healthcare will not be a “one-size-fits-all” system that treats every patient population equally. Diverse representation and inclusion in care plan decision-making and the hiring process will give us a plethora of culturally relevant considerations to properly educate and care for a diverse population. We will also champion long-term positive health outcomes rather than recidivism and customer creation. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Do you ever plan to expand? Nationally? Globally?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark> Cultured Healthcare plans to franchise this brand to positively impact the entire world, not just the City of Cincinnati, Ohio.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What’s the best advice anyone ever gave you regarding your non-profit?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark> GOD speaks to me every day. HE encourages me to keep going. HE has placed helpful people in my path, giving me the “green light” to keep going. My life’s purpose is to change the lives of the world's people for a better tomorrow. God is my push behind Cultured Healthcare.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What advice would you give anyone wanting to start their own business/non-profit?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark> For anyone who wants to start their own business/non-profit, I encourage you to do it. If you are passionate about it and it will positively impact the world, let nothing stop you from moving forward. Growing a business or non-profit is not an easy task. You’ll meet roadblocks along the way, but don’t get discouraged. CREATE another way to get where you are trying to go. Many people will tell you “NO,” keep going until you get that one yes that just may change your life. One door closed on you? Go to another door. <br/><br/>

Your biggest supporters often come from strangers who see your vision as inspiring, while those you are surrounded by will view you as competition. Surround yourself with those who want to build with you. People who make it to the top COLLABORATE TOGETHER, rather than compete against each other. They will see you as an inspiration and want to know how they can do it, too. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark>  How did you find out about Tsunoda Stylings?   <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark> I found out about Tsunoda Stylings from your website design for the African American Chamber of Commerce. I have used many of the services, and Tsunoda Stylings hasn’t disappointed me yet. The team is very timely and efficient and does what is necessary to make the client happy. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark>  Does your business give back to your community/charities? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark> Cultured Healthcare DEFINITELY plans to give back to the community. We will build our community outreach programs, provide scholarships, and support other non-profit organizations with the purpose of making the world a better place for all people.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark>  What are your goals for 2024?  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark> Cultured Healthcare’s goal for 2024 is to bring awareness to our mission and vision and raise enough money to invest in our first state-of-the-art building in the city of Cincinnati, Ohio. This facility will provide employment opportunities in a safe environment where everyone’s care is the primary focus. Not just the care of the patients but the mental health of the employees serving as well.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark>  Any closing remarks you would like to give to our readers?  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Brittany:</mark> It is up to all of us to change the narrative and create a better tomorrow for the children who come behind us. If we stand together, this can and will happen. Cultured Healthcare is tailored to you regardless of what your skin color is. Let’s do away with the capitalist one-size-fits-all healthcare system and create a consumer-first, tailor-made model that prioritizes outcomes over dollars. Care that truly revolves around you, not just with words but actions. Cultured Healthcare- Caring For Cultures Of The World!<br/><br/>
