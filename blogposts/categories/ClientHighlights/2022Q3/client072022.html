                        Tsunoda Stylings is a Japan-based agency that strives to create successful, responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with the best techniques. At Tsunoda Stylings, we search for new and experienced small business owners looking to promote their businesses without breaking the bank! Not too long after we opened our doors, we received a request from a mother on a mission that wanted a fresh and unique website redesign for her non-profit organization.<br/> <br/>

Please meet Tammy Floyd-Westmoreland. She is the founder and CEO of Their Voice of Greater Cincinnati! Not only does she manage her own beauty business, but she also wants to spread awareness for children with cerebral palsy. Read more below to learn more about her and what she plans to accomplish with her new site designed by Tsunoda Stylings.<br/> <br/>
 
<main class="interview">Interview with Tammy Floyd-Westmoreland:</main><br/>
 
<mark style=" background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Tell us a little about your background and how you became the founder/president of the organization (How did it start? Was it your idea or did you take over the organization from someone else?)<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tammy:</mark> I became the founder of Their Voice of Greater Cincinnati 5 years ago. My son Tae was born Nov 8, 1995, and was diagnosed with Cerebral palsy and epilepsy. He passed away at the age of 15 years old in Jan 2011. A few years after his passing, I knew there was more for me to do. That I needed to help other families who were just like us who lacked support and resources. So with my two-year-old's help and love of lipgloss, we started Qute Cosmetics, a lipgloss line. It was our way to spread awareness and raise funds for families affected by cerebral palsy. <br/> <br/> In 2017 I knew there was more for me to do, but I didn't know what or how to do it.

At the time, I was finishing up my book and going back and forth with the title name. At the last minute, I added we are their voices. Their voices just kept sitting in the pit of my stomach every morning I woke up. In 2018 my book, Life Before and After Cerebral palsy, We Are Their Voices, was published. And that was the year we had our first fundraiser for Their Voice of Greater Cincinnati. <br/> <br/> I never had the support or resources I needed to care for my son, so I wanted to create a space/place for other parents to give them the resources and things needed to live a somewhat semi-normal life without the stress of being a parent to a child with a medical diagnosis. So this was all God's plan! From the day I gave birth, he knew that I had a purpose, but I wouldn't quite find out what that was until after the passing of my son. My son taught me strength, patience, and unconditional love; everything I need to live and walk in my purpose.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What is your mission?<br/> <br/>

<mark style=" background-color: white;">Tammy:</mark>Our mission is to uplift, inspire and support (mentally, financially, physically and emotionally) families affected by cerebral palsy. <br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What services do you offer? <br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tammy:</mark> The services we provide are house cleaning, respite care, self care pamper days and support groups. <br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark>  What are your biggest accomplishments as an organization?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tammy:</mark> Our biggest accomplishment thus far is launching our respite program and receiving a grant from the United Way, Black Empowerment Works for $25,000.00<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Are you active in any other organizations/foundations/charities?<br/> <br/>

<mark style=" background-color: white;">Tammy:</mark> I am also a mentor for Ladies of Leadership, a non-profit organization that mentors young girls from ages 8-18 years old. We mentor with a purpose, changing one life at a time. I am currently trying to get a charity/scholarship fund in honor of my late mother-in-law Mozella Westmoreland.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark>  Do you (Their Voice) have any sponsors or are you a sponsor for anyone?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tammy:</mark> Yes our biggest sponsors are the United Way, Cincinnati Children's Medical Center and Qute Cosmetics. Our annual fundraiser sponsors are the African American Chamber of Commerce and Triversity Construction, and the Cochran Firm for now. <br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What is your biggest annual event? What does it raise awareness to/money for?<br/> <br/>

<mark style=" background-color: white;">Tammy:</mark>Our biggest event are our annual, Our last few raised awareness for our respite program. The first year we raised enough to sponsor a family for a year for baby wipes. In the second year, we raised enough for a family to put down a downpayment for a wheelchair-accessible van. <br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What are the biggest challenges of heading a charity organization?<br/> <br/>

<mark style=" background-color: white;">Tammy:</mark>The biggest challenge as of now is not having enough people on my staff/team. Everything still falls on me, so If I don't do it, then it won't get done. On top of running a form profit, being a mom, wife, sometimes working as a nurse, etc. can sometimes become overwhelming. 
<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What would you do you hope to accomplish in 2022? What are your goals for the future?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tammy:</mark>  I hope to accomplish in 2022 to get more grants to help with our services and enough money so that I can get paid because the only way we can be successful is if I am giving Their voice of Greater Cincinnati 100% which means trying to work 12-hour shifts as a nurse makes it impossible to focus solely on Their voice. To get more monthly sponsors and more corporate sponsors. <br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What advice would you give to anyone trying to get involved in their local/national organizations?
<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tammy:</mark>Make sure you are passionate about what you want to do and make sure that you can dedicate time to it. A non-profit is not a typical 9-5; it is a 24/7 job! <br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Any closing comments for our readers? <br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tammy:</mark>Always follow your heart and do what you love to do! Life is short and precious. Live in the moment. And figure out your purpose in life and walk in it!! Live Laugh and Love! <br/> <br/>
