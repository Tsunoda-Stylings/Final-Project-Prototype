                        <br/><main class="interview">Interview with Dr. Valencia Moses:</main><br/>

                        <p class="blog-p"><mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Tell me a little about your background.  What made you decide to become a life coach, and why this specifically? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark> As a college instructor, I realize the impact I had on my students was connected to how I was coaching them to overcome challenges. Before resilience became trendy, I was helping my students focus on what was within their control, how they could leverage their current skillset, and helping them stay motivated. This is what started the journey of wanting to figure out how I could do more of making a difference in the lives of others beyond the classroom setting. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Why did you decide to become a business owner?  When and how did you start your business? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark> I experienced breakthrough in my own life through the way the CliftonStrengths Assessment helped me better understand myself. I was inspired to become a Gallup-Certified Strengths Coach in order to help other people access a way of thinking and talking about themselves that gets them excited about their ability to craft a more fulfilling life. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> How did you come up with the name of your company?  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark> I thought about changing my name to Vibrant because it is the word that best describes the energy I bring to the world! Instead of going through that process, I decided to save the name to use in a significant way. It became the perfect name for my coaching company. As I like to say it, life coaching with Dr. V is Vibrant Coaching! <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What is your mission/company saying? How did you come up with that? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark> “Be the BEST you on purpose” is the mission because we are able to operate as powerful people when we live with intentionality. People are hungry for the chance to live a meaningful and fulfilling life. Part of living our “best life” is being aware of who we are, what we offer, and doing more of what we do best.  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What services do you offer?  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark>  Vibrant Coaching provides service to individual as well as organizational clients. Popular offerings have included customized workshops, one-on-one sessions, and strategic planning retreats virtually or in-person.   <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What services would you like to add in the future? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark> Vibrant Coaching will grow to include group coaching sessions to gather like-minded people together to focus on a specific topic to reach a measurable goal. I have been able to learn a great deal about the kinds of experiences people want to go through as part of a community in a way that has built-in accountability. Vibrant Coaching has assisted clients in a variety of areas of life: business, career, accountability, life-purpose, greater confidence, stress reduction, well-being, and increasing clarity to name a few.  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What is unique about your company? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark>  I was encouraged to describe the coaching I provide in terms of helping people enjoy their work and develop a plan for success that fits with who they are + what they value. Clients are surprised by the insights they gain and repeatedly share they are glad to have invested in themselves through coaching. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What’s the best piece of advice anyone ever gave you in regard to your business?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark> I was in a free coaching session and the coach told me that I bring people joy and I should market myself as someone who could help people enjoy their lives more. This advice really resonated with me and I aim to figure out how to include the joy I bring as a bigger part of my marketing message moving forward! <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What advice would you give anyone wanting to start their own business?  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark> I believe it is important to give yourself grace to learn as you go and time to transition into being in business full-time. Vibrant Coaching has helped a host of entrepreneurs hone in on the best next steps to take across a realistic span of time, while encouraging them to connect with resources that are going to support the learning curve that comes with being self-employed. Not everyone can start a business one day and gain financial independence in a month’s time. Because of the variation that comes with being a solopreneur or part of a team running a business, it is important that business owners have a plan for how they can grow their business to partially or fully fund their best life. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> How did you find out about Tsunoda Stylings?  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark> Tsunoda Stylings came highly recommended by Briston Mitchell with the African American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky after I mentioned I was looking to refresh my website. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Does your business give back to your community/charities? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark> Dr. V: Vibrant Coaching gives 10% of its earnings to a local non-profit and offers workshops to entrepreneurs to keep them encouraged while they meet their goals for growth. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What are your goals for 2023?  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark> Vibrant Coaching is in the process of forming new partnerships with mission-driven organizations in order to support leaders as they navigate workplace challenges by investing in team-member well-being across levels within the organization. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Any closing remarks you would like to give to our readers?  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Dr. V:</mark> Everyone who is at the top of their game across every industry invests in coaching. I believe that coaching is a key ingredient in the recipe for a better life. I am a coach who is regularly receiving coaching, so I want others to benefit from the difference that coaching can make.
