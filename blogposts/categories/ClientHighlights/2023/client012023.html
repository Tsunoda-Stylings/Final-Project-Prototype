She is talented, hard-working, passionate, and excited about giving children the caring nurture they need and deserve.

                        <br/><main class="interview">Interview with Penny Morgan:</main><br/>

                        <p class="blog-p"><mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Tell me a little about your background.  When and how did you start your business? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Penny:</mark>   I come from a family of 12 brothers and sisters. I am a mother of 8, 2 of whom I adopted. I have 14 grandchildren. I was a foster parent for 8 years and impacted over 60+ children. I love to crochet, cook, dance, and listen to all genres of music. I love the color purple, and I am learning to play the saxophone. I have a bachelor’s degree in early childhood education (BS) and a master’s degree in early childhood studies (Med).

<br/><br/>I started doing daycare back in 2001 I was a stay-at-home mom at the time. I enjoyed being with my children however I was ready to join the workforce. Mid-2001, my young children were now in preschool, and I found a part-time job. It was awesome I enjoyed getting out of the house. However, I was not happy with the way things were going. I found out from my children’s school program about Community Action Agency (Headstart). I learned about their headstart enhancement program and Job and Family Services child care program. I joined both, and the rest is history.

  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Why did you decide to become a business owner/childcare provider?  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Penny:</mark>  I have always wanted to be a teacher. My mother told me as a child; I had a class with all of my dolls. I was teaching them what I had learned in school. Therefore, I decided that I needed to stay home to nurture and educate my own children as well as those in the neighborhood. Later in 2001, I decided that I wanted to start my own business being a childcare provider.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> How did you come up with the name of your company?  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Penny:</mark>  The name for my business came from my best friend, the late Leah Danielle Shippy. She was my sister from another mother. She was my best encourager and supporter when I wanted to start my own business. I told her I needed a name for the business. She is really good at creating different names. She was the one to name my youngest child. She combined my name and dad's name to get his. I asked can you help me with a name for my business. About a week or 2 later, she said how about Loving Kindness. I was very excited. I added the rest, and that’s how the name came about.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What is your mission/company saying? How did you come up with that?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Penny:</mark>  Our slogan is Where Love and Kindness go Hand -n- Hand. This is our slogan because you cannot have one without the other. Love is always kind.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What services or programs do you offer?  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Penny:</mark>  Our services are child daycare services for children ages 12 weeks to 12 years old. We are open Mon – Fri from 630am until 5 pm. We offer before and after-school care for school-age children. We have a summer program. <br/><br/>

Services I would like to add in the future are computer classes, financial literacy classes, and GED classes, all for adults. My goal in the future is to have a multifaceted program that touches the whole family.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What is unique about your company/center?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Penny:</mark>   The things that make our program unique are the activities we offer the children. We have a cooking class every Wednesday and two times a month we have a chef come. We have yoga exercises and activities. We have a garden where we grow our own herbs and vegetables.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What’s the best piece of advice anyone ever gave you in regard to your business?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Penny:</mark> All I remember is to give your all in every situation. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What advice would you give to anyone who wanted to start their own business?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Penny:</mark>   Keep an open mind and never ever give up!<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> How did you find out about Tsunoda Stylings? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Penny:</mark> I found out about Tsunoda Stylings through a fellow church member<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Does your business give back to your community/charities?  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Penny:</mark>  Yes.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What are your goals for 2022? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Penny:</mark> Settle my business into a bigger location and begin to incorporate the new services. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Any closing remarks you would like to give to our readers? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Penny:</mark> My goal is to reach as many young children as possible. Helping them develop a love for learning in and out of school for the rest of their lives. Which gives them a hope for a better future.
