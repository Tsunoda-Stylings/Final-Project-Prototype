                        <br/><main class="interview">Interview with Tiayasine Cobb:</main><br/>

                        <p class="blog-p"><mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Tell me a little about your background.  When and how did you start your business?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tia:</mark> Hello, my name is Tiayasine Cobb, I go by Remy, which is more like my stage name for doing hair. I took a liking to doing hair in 2006-07’ not to be actually in business but just to put a few dollars in my pocket.  <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Why did you decide to become a business owner? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tia:</mark> I eventually had clients out the roof, so I decided to go to empire beauty school. I finished school in 2017 and received my license in 2018, and COCKII BEHAVIOR was born.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> How did you come up with the name of your company? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tia:</mark> I chose COCKII Behavior as a name because of one thing PEACOCKS, they are bold and beautiful. They possess a uniqueness that makes them stand out, and I noticed this from the zoo. They are the only (animals) to roam freely, they are truly COCKII. That’s how I want my clients to feel bold, beautiful, and COCKII. I want them in every aspect to respect that being COCKII isn’t just an attitude it’s a BEHAVIOR, when I see my client's whole attitude change, I know I’ve understood the assignment<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> How long did you study cosmetology? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tia:</mark> I’ve been doing hair since I was 16 years old and would like to go further with it on a bigger platform, I believe there’s more ahead of me as long as I put my heart to rest and my mind to work. I say that because this career choice is easy but also can be intimidating, I’ve had days where I wanna give up and throw the towel in, but then I realize this is what I love. A 9-5 was basic and uninteresting doing hair is more of a challenge, a form of art to me. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What services or products do you offer at your salon? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tia:</mark> When you come to COCKII behavior, there are a ton of services you can get done, pixie wigs, wig installs,sew-ins, lashes &brows, and my infamous pixie cuts, etc. I provide my clients with pixie cut wigs they are easy and convenient, they last longer, and I can always wash and restyle them. I have also taken up micro-shading and how to install mink individual lashes. I specialize In pixie cuts and razor cuts, but I am also fluent in other styles such as braiding, weaves, up-do’s, and making wigs.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Do you make any of the hair oils/products yourself? Do you want to in the future? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tia:</mark> Now, I have a lot of women that have hair loss, and I would like to create something that would help them with that issue, from thinning in the middle and around the edges to complete baldness.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What’s the best piece of advice anyone ever gave you in regard to your business?<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tia:</mark> I can honestly say through it all, the best advice I’ve taken heed to is never stop and keep going, meaning there may be other competitors, but you still proceed with your goal. When you walk into a store, down the chip aisle, there are lay’s, Grippo's, Tostitos, etc., but that doesn’t stop those companies from putting out because there’s another brand to the left or the right of them. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What advice would you give to anyone who wanted to start their own business? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tia:</mark> The sky isn’t the limit, it’s beyond that. Why stop at the sky when NASA is going for Mars, that’s the outer limit, or so they say.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> How did you find out about Tsunoda Stylings? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tia:</mark>  I do wanna applaud Mrs.Theresa Lackey for helping me along the way, she has shown me a lot of things to help me get my business off the ground, for one, starting with introducing me to Tsunoda Stylings.<br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Does your business give back to your community/charities? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tia:</mark>  I have been wanting to do more collaborations with makeup artists and stylists for charity. I recently did Gutta kay from “the Bad Boys Club, a reality star on the Zeus network, and to my surprise, Mrs. Cardi B loved his hair, which was a finger wave set, and I also provided him with a pixie cut wig from the COCKII collection. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What are your goals for 2022? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tia:</mark> My goal is to succeed in every aspect and feed my children, I want to leave them something behind that will help them stay united and keep together as a family. I want to teach them there are ways to be successful, you can be the president or the president of your own company. Never be afraid of failure. <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Any closing remarks you would like to give to our readers? <br/><br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Tia:</mark>  With it all being said and done, I dedicate all this to my mother, Diane Cobb, who has pushed me and stood behind me the entire time. I would never have made it to where I am without her speeches I can’t let her down I hope she continues to guide me along the way from heaven's gates. <br/><br/>
