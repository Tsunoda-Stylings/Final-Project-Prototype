                        <p class="blog-p">Tsunoda Stylings is a Japan-based agency that strives to create successful, responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with the best techniques. At Tsunoda Stylings, we search for new and experienced small business owners looking to promote their businesses without breaking the bank! Not too long after we opened our doors, we received a request from an passionate career coach that wanted a unique hand-coded custom website made. <br/> <br/> Please meet CJ the Career Queer. He is not only a multi-lingual international educator, but he also helps those looking for answers to their career problems as well as coming into their true selves. Read more below to learn more about him and what he plans to accomplish with his new custom designed site by Tsunoda Stylings.<br/> <br/></p>

                        <main class="interview">Interview with CJ:</main><br/>

                        <mark style=" background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Tell us a little about your background and what made you decide to pursue a career in your industry?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">CJ:</mark> My first career was as a teacher, which I absolutely loved, but the industry where I live is either highly regulated or extremely toxic. I always had the idea that I would teach until a point where I could get more education, and maybe one day become a guidance counselor. A fellow teacher introduced me to a program in career development and it seemed like an amazing chance to do what I wanted to do and get out of the toxic career I was in at the same time.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What is your mission?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">CJ:</mark> While I was studying career development, I realized that, although every Queer practitioner I spoke to agreed that it was something we needed, there weren’t any general programs catering to LGBTQIA+ and 2S people. So, my mission is to provide peer-to-peer career coaching to any Queer person with as few barriers to service as I can manage.<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark>  What Are The Main Benefits Of Your Career Coaching?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">CJ:</mark>  Primarily, offering peer-to-peer services. Folks using WIP’s services know that I’m queer - I share some of the same experiences and concerns and I’m not going to take away from their time with questions like “how do I use they/she pronouns?” or “why is it important that you be out as asexual at work?” Clients can feel comfortable knowing I ‘speak their language’ as it were.<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> You offer your services as Pay-As-You-Can, can you elaborate on this concept and why you decided to do it?<br/> <br/>

<mark style=" background-color: white;">CJ:</mark> The Pay-As-You-Can model helps provide access with fewer barriers. Clients can pay how much makes sense for them and it’s flexible. Something like Career Exploration, for example, can take many sessions - budgets can change over time, so PAYC means they don’t have to stop because they have a month where money is tighter, they can just change how much they’re paying. And something like Job Tool Coaching - which is to improve on job search tools like resumes - is more likely to be used by someone who isn’t working and doesn’t have disposable income, but with PAYC, they can still get the help they need whether or not they can pay for it. There is a suggested rate of $25/hr that folks can use as a guideline, but any amount is acceptable!<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark>   What aspects of your career do you enjoy, and what do you wish you could change or stop entirely?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">CJ:</mark>  I really like helping support people in finding and achieving their goals. I wish it were easier in terms of a lot of folks concerns are around discrimination and money. If it weren’t for those things, career exploration could be so much more focused on finding passion, value, and joy at work.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What are your biggest accomplishments to date?<br/> <br/>

<mark style=" background-color: white;">CJ:</mark>  I talk a lot with clients about transferable skills - since a lot of the time we’re discussing them moving into a new career or their resume. It feels so incredibly satisfying every time someone realizes that they have more skills than they thought and the confidence they get from that. <br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Are you active in any organizations/foundations/charities?<br/> <br/>

<mark style=" background-color: white;">CJ:</mark> I’m a new member of the Canadian Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Do you (WIP) have any sponsors or are you a sponsor for anyone? Do you wish to collaborate with anyone/foundation?<br/> <br/>


<mark style="background-color: white;">CJ:</mark>  I would love for that to happen.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What do you hope to accomplish in 2022? What are your goals for the future? <br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">CJ:</mark> My goal for 2022 is to be able to serve everyone who asks. In the future, I hope to make WIP my full-time job, have community partnerships, and maybe even add to our staff.<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What advice would you give to anyone looking for a career coach/mentor? <br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">CJ:</mark> My first bit of advice would be to actually look for a career coach/mentor! Most people don’t think it’ll benefit them, but almost everyone who does use career services reports that it was extremely helpful.<br/> <br/>
