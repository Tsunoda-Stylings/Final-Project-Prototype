                        Tsunoda Stylings is a Japan-based agency that strives to create successful, responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with the best techniques. At Tsunoda Stylings, we search for new and experienced small business owners looking to promote their businesses without breaking the bank! Not too long after we opened our doors, we received a request from a former home care provider that wanted a fresh and unique website for her newest business venture.<br/> <br/>

Please meet Ashley Brogden. She is the founder and CEO of FabulousYou LLC! She is talented, hard-working, passionate, and excited about giving women the spa treatments they need and deserve. Read more below to learn more about her and what she plans to accomplish with her new site designed by Tsunoda Stylings.<br/> <br/>

<main class="interview">Interview with Ashley Brogden:</main><br/>
 
<mark style=" background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Tell me a little about your background. When and how did you start your business?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Ashley:</mark> I started off as a home care provider, and I did that for 8 years before starting my business. I obtained my LLC for FabulousYou LLC on 7/19/2021. I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do at that time. It was more of me wanting to walk into my fabulous. This was the beginning phase. <br/><br/>

I was on Facebook one night and came across a woman's page named Jasmine Maria Gentry. She provided a certified Vaginal Steam Facilitator course, which also included a Foot Detox course. I passed the course and obtained my certification on March 8th, 2022. After my first certification, I came across Body Gamers Spa LLC. This was when I became interested in body contouring. I got certified in body sculpting and wood therapy, Vsteams, red light therapy, and more. <br/><br/>

Everything went hand and hand with what I was learning to do. I was well on my way with my business plans, and I got certified on March 11th, 2022, for my online body contouring courses. I also attended John Academy for my Luxury Facial course and got the certification on March 30th. <br/><br/>

Now all of my certifications make up FabulousYou LLC. I want everyone to walk in their fabulous and feel great about themselves with my help. I still have the passion for helping people as I always have, just in a different way.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Why did you decide to become a business owner?<br/> <br/>

<mark style=" background-color: white;">Ashley:</mark> I became a business owner because I had two small children, and I was tired of clocking into a job. I want to be a stay-at-home mom and set my own hours. To have more time, money, and financial freedom for my family. It's always been a dream to have my own business and create a legacy.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> How did you come up with the name for your company?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Ashley:</mark> I came up with the name FabulousYou LLC because I felt this was me walking into my fabulous part of my life, becoming a legal business owner.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What is your mission/company saying? How did you come up with that?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Ashley:</mark> My mission is to "Build Barbies One Woman At A Time The Natural Way And Start Walking In Your Fabulous Today." I just want everyone to feel good about themselves in their skin, and I want to help them with that. I want them to feel fabulous and comfortable without the pain of surgery.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> How long did you study? Are there any other certifications you would like to get in the future?<br/> <br/>

<mark style=" background-color: white;">Ashley:</mark> I studied from each course from home. One of the classes was one day for 8 hours, and I finished the test the following day. The facial class, however, took 4 weeks. The body contouring courses took 12 hours of non-stop courses, studying, and quizzes on a zoom chat. After I still had manuals to go over. But in the future, I also plan to take micro-blading, waxing, and lash courses.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark>  What services or products do you offer?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Ashley:</mark> I offer Yoni Steams, Luxury Spa Facials, Wood Therapy, Red Light Therapy, Vaccum Therapy, Massages and Body Contouring.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Do you make any of the oils/products yourself? Do you want to in the future?<br/> <br/>

<mark style=" background-color: white;">Ashley:</mark> At this time I have made an aloe and lime facial exfoliator. I also made ginger oil for your stomach with basic ingredients. I look forward to making more natural products in the future.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What is unique about your company?<br/> <br/>

<mark style=" background-color: white;">Ashley:</mark> What makes my company unique is you can come to one place to get all of these services. I am passionate about each service that I provide.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What’s the best piece of advice anyone ever gave you in regards to your business?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Ashley:</mark> The best piece of advice in regards to my business is to trust the process and to give my clients the best results on their journey with all their natural body needs. <br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> How did you find out about Tsunoda Stylings?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Ashley:</mark> I found out about Tsunoda Stylings from our brother Marc Knott. :)<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> Does your business give back to your community/charities?<br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Ashley:</mark> At this time I do not give back to the community or charities but I do plan to in the future as right now my business is still up and coming.<br/> <br/>
 
<mark style="background-color: #651e9f; color: white;">Jasmine:</mark> What are your goals for 2022? <br/> <br/>

<mark style="background-color: white;">Ashley:</mark> My goals for 2022 is to get my business out there for the world to see and just have a successful business!<br/> <br/>
