                        <p class="blog-p">As humans, we are visual creatures that experience most of our lives through visuals rather than text. In marketing, visual storytelling offers endless opportunities to express stories through various mediums.

                          <h3 class="mb-3">1. Why Visual Storytelling?</h3>
                            
                        <img class="blog-top" src="/images/2023/tips 2.png" alt="YouTube">
                        <h6 class="blog-text"> Whether you're trying to persuade someone to buy your product, or you're trying to get people interested in volunteering at your organization, visual storytelling is one of the best ways to engage your audience.
Visual storytelling has been proven again and again as one of the most effective ways to tell a story. It can help you connect with people on a deeper level than just using words alone.
With visual storytelling, you can really make an impact on your audience and encourage them to take action.

                        <img class="blog-top" src="/images/2023/tips 3.png" alt="YouTube">
                        <h6 class="blog-text"> If you're picturing your teacher in front of a powerpoint, you've got it all wrong. Infographics are much more than that. In fact, they're one of the best ways to market your product or service. In other words, they present information quickly and easily.
Infographics are one such tool that can be used to market anything, from a small business to a major corporation. But what exactly is an infographic? And how can you use them in your marketing efforts?
</h6>
</div>

<h3>What is an Infographic?</h3>

<p class="blog-p"> An infographic is a visual representation of information or data. This can include charts and graphs, but they can also be illustrations, photographs, or even videos. Infographics may appear on their own or as part of an article or blog post, and are easy to read and understand, even if you’re not familiar with the content. They can also be shared on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
<br/><br/>As with any piece of content you create for your business, you should have a clear purpose for creating infographics for marketing purposes. Infographics help improve your content viewership and even improve your brand credibility.

<div class="blog-float">
                          <h3 class="mb-3">3. Shake It Like A Polaroid </h3>
                            
                        <img class="blog-top" src="/images/2023/tips 4.png" alt="YouTube">
                        <h6 class="blog-text"> Photographs make your business more appealing/attractive. If you want to stand out from the crowd, having good quality images will definitely help.
There are a lot of reasons to use photography in marketing.
Photography is such an important part of marketing because it helps brands connect with people on an emotional level—and that creates trust.
It's not just because everyone loves a good photo. It's also because photos can help you connect with your audience in a way that words alone can't. They allow you to show them what you do, rather than telling them about it.
Photographs make your content more memorable. 

<br/><br/>If you want people to remember what you have written about or shared with them, having a picture associated with it will help them recall what they read or viewed faster than if there was no image at all!
Photos from stock photo sites are a great place to start. Sites like Shutterstock and Pexels are full of high-quality stock photos that can be used for free (with attribution).
In general, images with people tend to be more impactful than those without. Additionally, if possible, try to use images that have been shot locally—it will help build trust with your local audience.

                          <h3 class="mb-3">4. Back To The Drawing Board </h3>
                            
                        <img class="blog-top" src="/images/2023/tips 5.png" alt="YouTube">
                        <h6 class="blog-text"> Illustrations are used in marketing to help convey information more clearly and effectively than text alone. They're also a great way to make your brand stand out since they're so eye-catching and unique.

When you look at the packaging for Coca-Cola Cans, the iconic font is part of what is called product packaging. Another type is logos and iconography like Apple’s Apple, the Nike Swish mark, or even the Tsunoda Stylings logo!

<br/><br/>It's all about making your customers feel like they understand the product and that they can see themselves using it. Illustrations can help you do that by showing how something might fit into their lives or how they might use it.
</h6>
</div>

<div class="blog-float">
                          <h3 class="mb-3">5. Good Illustrations </h3>
                            
                        <img class="blog-top" src="/images/2023/tips 6.png" alt="YouTube">
                        <h6 class="blog-text"> A good illustration is an image that tells your customers exactly what you're selling without having to say a word. Just by looking at it, they'll know how it's going to benefit them.

Let's say you're a toy company, and you want to sell more toys to kids like this one in particular—the one who doesn't wait for someone else to tell him what to do or how to play. You could use words like "explore," "discover," "create," and "invent," but those are all pretty vague concepts that won't really resonate with kids.

<br/><br/>But if you use an illustration instead of words—like this one—you can show kids exactly what kind of play experience they can have with your product! This picture shows them exactly what kinds of things they can do with their new toy: build things, create unique designs, and figure out how things work. They don't need anyone telling them what they should do or how they should play—they just know it when they see it!

<div class="blog-float">
                          <h3 class="mb-3">6. One Hundred and One Animations </h3>
                            
                        <img class="blog-top" src="/images/2023/tips 7.png" alt="YouTube">
                        <h6 class="blog-text"> Animation is not just for kids.

Animation can be a powerful marketing tool, and it can be used in a variety of ways and styles.

“How To” animation is used to demonstrate how to use a product or service. It can be very useful for explaining how something works—especially if it's complicated or unfamiliar territory for your audience. For example, if you're selling a new kind of social media app, an animated video showing how it works might be helpful for customers who want to download yours instead of another brand.

When it comes to your own brand, storytelling can tell your company’s story and how your products and services fit into those stories.</h6>
