                                    <p class="blog-p">In our last blog post, we dove deep into what Kickstarter is and how it works. Now, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and get serious about launching your campaign.
                                        Last year, I had the incredible opportunity to be part of a creator team for their first Kickstarter project—a funding campaign for the second part of their documentary on LGBT+ life in Japan. It was an eye-opening experience that taught me valuable lessons about launching a successful campaign. As we navigated the highs and lows, I discovered firsthand what makes a Kickstarter project thrive. If you’re planning your own campaign, I want to share these insights with you—woven with practical tips and essential strategies to ensure your project gets the funding it deserves.

                                        <h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold blog-title">The Importance of Preparation
                                        </h3>
                                        <br/>
                                    <img class="blog-top" src="/images/2025/Kickstarter Tips 2.png" alt="Google Fonts"> 
                                    <h6 class="blog-text">One of the biggest lessons I learned was that preparation is everything. When we started, we only had a month to prepare before launch, and looking back, that wasn’t nearly enough time. We found ourselves scrambling to finalize key elements, and while we were ultimately successful, I now know how crucial it is to plan ahead.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Before launching your campaign, create a solid roadmap. This includes:<br/><br/>
Researching similar projects and reading reviews to understand what worked and what didn’t<br/><br/>
Holding multiple brainstorming and planning meetings with your team<br/><br/>
Developing a pre-launch marketing strategy<br/><br/>
Creating a compelling campaign page with a clear and concise project description<br/><br/>

Your project description is the backbone of your campaign. Backers need to know exactly what they’re supporting, why it matters, and how it solves a problem. Our campaign’s success was partly due to its clear storytelling—people connected with the importance of LGBT+ representation in Japan. When crafting your description, highlight what sets your project apart and why it’s worth backing. Knowing what your project is and how to present it from the start makes it easier for people to understand your message. Plus, when your project is cohesive and well-structured, it’s much easier to navigate.
<br/><br/>Additionally, preparation serves as a reference point. With an outline of key tasks, a to-do list, or a detailed plan for engaging with your audience, having a guide helps you stay focused. This doesn’t mean everything needs to be perfect from the start—there will always be things you miss and areas for improvement. What matters is having a solid framework in place so that, when challenges arise, you know exactly what to do next. It’s like creating a safety net that keeps you grounded, even when you need to adapt to the unexpected.

                                    <h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold blog-title">Learning from the Backer’s Perspective
                                    </h3>

                                <h6 class="blog-text">One of the best things I did before working on the campaign was becoming a Kickstarter backer myself. Supporting other projects gave me valuable insight into what makes a campaign appealing. I observed how updates were handled, what kinds of rewards generated excitement, and how communication played a role in fostering trust.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    If you’re new to Kickstarter, I highly recommend backing a few projects before launching your own. This will help you:<br/><br/>
Understand the user experience from a backer’s perspective<br/><br/>
See what types of campaigns resonate with audiences<br/><br/>
Get ideas for structuring your own rewards and updates<br/><br/>
Taking the time to explore the backer’s experience gave me an important edge when it came to planning. Understanding how backers think and what makes them tick helps you better position your own campaign to resonate with the right audience. This also allowed me to recognize the importance of keeping backers engaged and excited from start to finish.

                                <h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold blog-title">Setting a Realistic and Attainable Funding Goal
                                </h3>
                                <br/>
                            <img class="blog-top" src="/images/2025/Kickstarter Tips 4.png" alt="Google Fonts">
                            <h6 class="blog-text">One of the questions we faced was how to set the right funding goal. A target that’s too high can discourage backers, while one that’s too low might not cover all the necessary expenses. We had to carefully budget every aspect, from production costs to marketing and shipping. Kickstarter also takes a 5% fee, which is something every creator must account for their goal.<br/><br/>
                                Before setting your funding target, break down your costs:<br/><br/>
                                Prototyping and production<br/><br/>
                                Marketing and promotions<br/><br/>
                                Shipping and fulfillment<br/><br/>
                                Unexpected expenses (always leave a buffer!)<br/><br/>
                                Being transparent about your budget builds trust with potential backers. If they see a well-researched breakdown of costs, they’re more likely to feel confident that their pledge is going toward something worthwhile. I can’t stress enough how important it is to include unexpected costs in your planning—there are always surprises in the process, and it’s better to overestimate than to be caught off guard.<br/><br/>
                                Luckily, most of our rewards were digital and offered domestically, so shipping costs weren’t a major concern for us. However, if you're a small business planning to sell products internationally, I strongly recommend factoring in international shipping costs from the start. These expenses can quickly add up, and it’s important to be upfront with backers about these potential costs.<br/><br/>

                        <h6 class="blog-text">One of the most striking things I learned was the power of visuals. A well-designed campaign page makes all the difference. For our campaign, we invested in high-quality images, a professional-looking video, and clear infographics to illustrate our message. Kickstarter projects with compelling visuals tend to perform significantly better than those without.<br/><br/>
                            When designing your page:<br/><br/>
                            Use high-resolution images and videos to showcase your product or concept (use Canva to help you!)<br/><br/>
                            Keep your layout clean and easy to navigate <br/><br/>
                            Make sure your calls to action are clear (e.g., "Back this project now!")<br/><br/>
                            Your campaign video is one of the most crucial elements. It should be short (around 2-3 minutes), engaging, and effectively communicate your project’s purpose. We filmed interviews with people featured in the film, included clips from the first part of the documentary, and added subtitles for accessibility. A great video can pull viewers in—people want to connect with the creators and understand the heart of the project. We found that incorporating personal stories and emotional visuals resonated deeply with our backers, which made them feel more invested in the campaign.<br/><br/>

                    <h6 class="blog-text">Another valuable tactic I discovered was creating a dummy account before submitting a project. Of course, this doesn’t mean launching a fake project, but rather using a test account to see the submission process from start to finish before going live. Doing this allowed me to:<br/><br/>
                        Identify all required fields and checklists before submitting a real project.<br/><br/>

                         <h6 class="blog-text">One thing that might seem obvious but is often overlooked is making sure everything works on mobile devices. Many backers browse Kickstarter on their phones, so you want to ensure the layout and videos look great on all screen sizes. It’s a small detail, but it can make a big difference. Kickstarter recommends using a 1024x576 resolution for videos to ensure the best viewing experience across all screen sizes.

                <h6 class="blog-text">Rewards play a significant role in attracting backers. One mistake we made was initially offering too many reward tiers, which confused potential backers. After some adjustments, we simplified our options and focused on unique, valuable rewards.<br/><br/>
                    Here’s what I recommend:<br/><br/>
                    Offer a variety of reward tiers (but not too many—5 to 7 is ideal)<br/><br/>
                    Include both digital and physical rewards<br/><br/>
                    Offer exclusive early bird discounts to encourage early pledges<br/><br/>
                    Make sure your reward pricing makes sense for your funding goal<br/><br/>
                    We learned that the key is to offer a mix of rewards that are attractive but also realistic. For example, offering digital rewards like exclusive content or behind-the-scenes access can be a great way to engage people without incurring too many additional costs. Offering a limited edition item for early backers creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, which helps generate early momentum.

                                <h6 class="blog-text">One of the things I wish we had done better was pre-launch marketing. While we did some promotion, a longer runway would have helped us gain even more traction before launching.<br/><br/>
                                    Ways to generate buzz before launch:<br/><br/>
                                    Build a social media presence early and engage with potential backers<br/><br/>
                                    Release teaser content and behind-the-scenes updates<br/><br/>
                                    Start an email list and send out regular updates<br/><br/>
                                    Collaborate with influencers or content creators in your niche<br/><br/>
                                    Kickstarter also offers a Pre-Launch Page where you can gather followers before your project goes live. We found this feature useful in building anticipation.

                         <h6 class="blog-text">One thing to keep in mind is that we worked in both English and Japanese. Kickstarter offers a language toggle, but it only changes the platform’s interface—your campaign content stays in the language you write it in. Since our main audience was in Japan, we wrote everything in Japanese first and then translated it into English to make it clear and accessible to a wider audience.

                            <h6 class="blog-text">One of the most exciting parts of our campaign was the launch event. We hosted a small online gathering where we introduced the project, answered questions, and encouraged early pledges. This gave us an initial boost in momentum—something that’s crucial for Kickstarter’s algorithm.<br/><br/>
                                If possible, plan a launch event—whether virtual or in-person—to create excitement and urgency. Giving people the opportunity to learn more about your project, ask questions, and engage directly helps build trust and enthusiasm. On the day of our Kickstarter launch, we held a screening of the first episode of the documentary and officially announced our campaign, which sparked immediate interest and led to a surge of early pledges.

                            Best practices for engaging with backers:<br/><br/>
                            Post frequent updates on your progress<br/><br/>
                            Respond to comments and messages promptly<br/><br/>

                            Be transparent about any challenges or delays<br/><br/>
                            Engaging backers doesn’t stop once the funding goal is reached. You need to maintain communication throughout the campaign and beyond to ensure people feel connected to the process.

It taught me the importance of preparation, clear communication, and community engagement. If you’re considering launching a project, take the time to research, plan ahead, and learn from others’ successes (and mistakes).<br/><br/>
                                            Kickstarter is a powerful platform that can bring creative ideas to life, but success isn’t guaranteed—it requires effort, strategy, and a deep understanding of your audience. By following these steps and learning from my experience, you’ll be well on your way to launching a campaign that not only meets its funding goal but also leaves a lasting impact.<br/><br/>
