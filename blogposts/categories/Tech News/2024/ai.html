                                    <h6 class="blog-text">AI, or artificial intelligence, is a digital computer or computer-controlled robot that can perform tasks commonly associated with intelligence, aka humans. This can include the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experiences. For example, Google’s optical character recognition (OCR) uses AI to recognize and extract text from images. As technology continues to advance, understanding how to leverage AI for your business and what AI is will become increasingly important. </h6>

                                    <h6 class="blog-text">AI, just like any other kind of technology, has been in development for years. It was first conceptualized in the 1950s when Alan Turing published his paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence." In this paper, Turing proposed the now-famous "Turing Test,” which would help tell the difference between a human and computer-written response. Six years later, John McCarthy created the phrase “artificial intelligence” at the first AI conference. In the same year, the first-ever AI software program, the Logic Theorist, was created by Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw, and Herbert Simon. These studies laid the foundation for what we know as AI today. AI has since continued to grow and evolve, including through research and development into machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. As of 2024, AI is used all over,  from virtual assistants to self-driving cars. </h6>

                                        Currently, the industries that use AI the most are the IT and finance sectors. However, it appears that the top two uses of AI in the near future will be for marketing automation and data analytics. In North Carolina, as of June 2024, 41% of NC businesses planning to use AI reported using it for marketing automation and 28% for data analytics.  As AI continues to advance technologically, it is expected to be adopted across a wide variety of industries.

These tools can increase efficiency, productivity, and accuracy in tasks such as data analysis, customer service, and project management.

This can give you or your employees more time to focus on more creative or complex areas of work instead.

                                        <br/>
                                    <img class="blog-top" src="/images/2024/ai5.jpg" alt="Visual Studio Code">
                                    <h6 class="blog-text">While the possibilities for AI are great, there are some drawbacks when it comes to using AI in the workplace. One concern that you may have seen debated is overreliance on AI technologies. ChatGPT, the most used free AI tool, is owned by one company, OpenAI, which accounted for nearly 80% of the global generative AI market in 2023. If OpenAI ever shuts down ChatGPT or pursues monetization, any users who rely on the free version will suddenly be unable to work effectively.  If you depend on free AI tools to keep your business running, it's important to have a backup plan in case of any sudden changes or disruptions in those tools. 

                                        <br/> <br/> Another drawback is that AI is not 100% free from mistakes. It can sometimes make errors or misinterpret data. If you use AI in your business, it is crucial that you have human oversight and quality control so that you can catch these mistakes.
                                        
                                        <br/> <br/>  Data breaches are also a concern when using AI tools. This occurs when sensitive or private information is plugged into AI systems that are not properly secured. AIs harvest information online from various different sources. Most of this is publicly available data, but there is always a risk of unintentionally accessing confidential, private, or personal data, which may be illegal or unethical for your business to use. Furthermore, the data that you plug into AI may end up in this publicly available data pool.
                                        
                                        <br/> <br/>Lastly, many jobs may be lost to automation as tasks are assigned to AI models. Companies should consider the ethical implications of using AI tools due to the potential impact on their workforce. The occupations at the highest risk of automation currently account for about 27% of employment in OECD countries. Sudden mass layoffs as a result of AI integration would come as a shock to workforces everywhere. However, among US businesses integrating AI in 2024, 88% reported that their employment levels would remain the same. </h6>
